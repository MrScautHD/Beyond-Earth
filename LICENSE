The Beyond-Earth License protects the Beyond-Earth Project and dedicated addons.

1. Any assets from the Beyond-Earth Project’s source files published on GitHub may
not be used in any other public projects (see 2.1. for usage in modpacks; see 2.2. for
usage in addons), unless explicitly stated otherwise by the Beyond-Earth Project’s
owner or by this license (Beyond-Earth License 1.0).

2. Usage of source files in other public projects:

  1. Usage of the Beyond-Earth .jar file in modpacks is allowed as long as both
  conditions (2.1.1. and 2.1.2.) are fulfilled.

    1. The mod is unmodified (excluding modification of config-files) and
    available in its entirety.
    2. The Beyond-Earth .jar used in the modpack was obtained on either
    CurseForge or Modrinth.

  2. Usage of Beyond-Earth source files in addons is limited to small portions of
  the java code, as long as Beyond-Earth is publicly credited. This means that
  while the usage of textures, models and sounds are off-limits, approximately
  300 lines of java code can be copied and/or modified for usage in the
  dedicated Beyond-Earth addon, if it is publicly stated that Beyond-Earth code
  is used.

3. All other rights reserved unless otherwise explicitly stated.
